## About

This project takes images of plants from users and uses machine learning to identify the plant disease and suggest a cure for it. It's like having a personal plant doctor who can diagnose your plants with a single snapshot! So go ahead, let your plants strike a pose and watch the magic happen. Just make sure they don't get camera shy! ðŸ“¸ðŸŒ¿

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Open `localhost:5000` in your browser

## How it Works

1. The user uploads an image of the plant
2. The image is sent to the server
3. The server runs a machine learning model on the image to identify the disease
4. The server sends the result back to the user
5. The user sees the result on the screen
